<h2>GlobalSign’s 2019 Predictions</h2>
</div>
<div class="news-article">
<p>It’s hard to believe but 2018 has flown by. The year has been marked by breaches at the world’s largest and most powerful social media outlets. The mother of them all, Facebook, had a fairly awful year and it is directly due to major security issues.</p>
<p>In late September, the company announced that a widespread security flaw affected as many as <a title="50 million users" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2018/09/28/facebook-sounds-alarm-as-security-bug-impacts-50-million-accounts/#e7c433022916" target="_blank">50 million users</a>. This only added insult to injury after the truly <a title="political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-mining-and-trump-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">stunning revelation</a> back in March that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. This sent Facebook’s stock price tumbling and CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself lost nearly $11 billion. He also had to <a title="Mark Zuckerberg had to testify in front of a week-long congressional panel in April." href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments" target="_blank">testify</a> in front of a week-long congressional panel in April. (Is Zuck ready for 2019, or what???) And, now it seems the company is <a title="Facebook is mulling the purchase of a major cybersecurity firm to avoid any future breaches" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90254683/facebook-wants-to-buy-a-cybersecurity-company" target="_blank">mulling the purchase</a> of a major cybersecurity firm to avoid any future breaches.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Google+ network, who just this month announced that private information for as many as half a million users was exposed. The breach was the <a title="Google+ network, who just this month announced that private information for as many as half a million users was exposed" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/08/google-shut-security-flaw-exposes-users-private-details/" target="_blank">final death knell</a> for the social network.</p>
<p>Of course, security breaches were not restricted to social media magnates in 2018. Retailers and restaurants took quite a hit as well, including <a title="security breaches of 2018" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/data-breaches-2018-4#best-buy-7" target="_blank">Macy’s, Best Buy, Panera Bread and Whole Foods</a>. Then of course there was a plethora of <a title="medical-related" href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/projects/biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-2018-so-far" target="_blank">medical-related</a> data breaches and those that <a title="targeted the government" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/state-department-confirms-data-breach-exposing-employee-data/" target="_blank">targeted the government</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully 2019 won’t be quite as punishing – especially if companies take more precautions when it comes to security. The security experts here at GlobalSign have once again taken a peek into their proverbial crystal balls. Here are some of our predictions for 2019.</p>
<h1>Lila Kee, General Manager and Chief Product Officer</h1>
<p><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/9915/0782/5017/Lila.fw.png" alt="Lila Kee" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe51522b"> <em>Adoption of digital signatures will soar</em></p>
<p>Adoption of Trusted Digital Signatures will soar as the eIDAS regulatory framework emerges as the gold standard for electronic signatures and digital identities. Organizations and governments will rapidly digitize work-flows and give solid legal foundations around digital signatures, and thereby eliminate paper process.</p>
<h1>Lancen LaChance, Vice President of Product Management, IoT Solutions</h1>
<p><em><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/4215/0782/5016/Lancen.fw.png" alt="Lancen" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe515274">The need for identity in Bitcoin will grow; PKI will become the de facto IoT standard</em></p>
<p>The need for identity in Bitcoin grows as it regains cryptocurrency dominance and its layer two solution, the Lightning Network, will gain early adoption from mainstream payment providers. Meanwhile, PKI will become the <em>de facto</em> standard for IoT authentication and identity, as early IoT projects gain traction and adoption, especially in industrial, energy, medical, and telecommunications use cases.</p>
<p>Blockchain is here to stay and it is way more than just cryptocurrencies. Like new technologies, it’s a matter of finding ways to use it and making it compatible for commercialization by the masses. Companies will invest in R&amp;D next year to find ways to utilize this technology for other purposes like smart contracts and authentication.</p>
<h1 class="xmsonormal">Arvid Vermote, Chief Information Security Officer</h1>
<p class="xmsonormal"><em><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/2115/4038/0993/Arvid_circle.fw.png" alt="Arvid" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe5152bb"> </em><em>The world will follow the EU’s footsteps to combat online fraud</em></p>
<p>Led by the EU, countries around the world will increasingly adopt legislation requiring high level assurance signatures on digital contracts and transactions in order to fight online fraud and criminality by ensuring identity and integrity.</p>
<p>The need for identity within blockchain will become more pertinent and various stakeholders will offer proposals how to solve the identity need, within which, PKI technology will be used to resolve the issue by linking identities to blockchain addresses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, more organizations will move towards a co-sourced Security Operations Center (SOC) model, where an external expert party performs advanced analysis of events combined with internal event handlers that do the actual triaging and handling of events.</p>
<p>As more and more IoT devices and technologies reach the consumer and corporate market, breaches will increasingly be caused by vulnerabilities within these devices. The required focus and difficulties with securing IoT devices or networks will become more apparent.</p>
<h1>John Murray, Vice President of Sales – West</h1>
<p><em><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/9115/4038/1253/John_Murray_cirlce.fw.png" alt="John Murray" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe515302"> </em><em>Email will continue to be an easy target for phishers</em></p>
<p>Emails leveraging services you use, and trust everyday can be easily created to fool the enterprise user. In 2019, next generation, socially engineered and targeted phishing emails appearing to come from within the “trusted enterprise” will continue to scale, resulting in escalating business productivity and financial losses.</p>
<h1 class="xmsonormal">Nisarg Desai, Director of Product Management, IoT Solutions</h1>
<p><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/7615/4038/1374/Nisarg_circle.fw.png" alt="Nisarg" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe515349"> <em>IaaS providers will drive security best practices</em></p>
<p class="xmsonormal">Infrastructure-as-a-service providers (IaaS) such as Google, Microsoft (Azure) and Amazon Cloud will drive security best practices for the IoT in 2019. There was a lack of standards and regulation this year, and this will remain so next year.</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">These IaaS providers will do this in much the same way Google has driven best practices around TLS. Ultimately, these security practices will become the <em>de facto</em> rules. This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone given the advancements being made in their IoT device management platforms and capabilities. This is a win for overall cybersecurity, since all of these companies are very security conscious.</p>
<h1>Richard Hancock, GMO Group Manager for Data Protection and Privacy – West</h1>
<p><em><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/4715/0782/5262/Richard.fw.png" alt="richard" width="85" height="85"> The impact of GDPR beyond 2018</em></p>
<p>2018 was the year that we’ve all been waiting for. For six years, the data protection world eagerly anticipated the next generation of regulations that took existing data protection laws to a whole new level. Marketers weren’t so eager. Since GDPR took effect on May 25<sup>th</sup>, we’ve seen some interesting things happen, most notably of which was ICANN’s burying of their head in the sand as well as German court giving us some guidance and precedent on data minimization (if you don’t need it, don’t collect it). So, in 2019, we will undoubtedly see a sharp rise in the number of organizations truly coming to grips with GDPR.</p>
<p>Even now in October 2018, research suggests that considerably less than 50% of the commercial world is fully compliant. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) were talking about streamlining the Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) application and accreditation process and I would hope to see this realised next year. I’ve spoken with many companies who are grappling for a legal basis to process their data on a global scale but standard contractual clauses and BCR’s are just too cumbersome for them so a little help from the supervisory body would be welcomed by Data Protection Officer’s (DPO) and Chief Legal Officers (CLO).</p>
<p>Upcoming changes to the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR) to more closely align with the GDPR will see a fascinating strategy unfold amongst marketers and the political climate changes coming at the end of Q1 will have gargantuan impact to the way data is processed.</p>
<p>Where 2019 will also be noteworthy will be the precedent setting case law. Currently, all eyes are on the likes of Google and Facebook, but the following 12 months will, I would hope, bring some clarity to areas of current ambiguity. One hopes that by the end of the year, most of the interpretation and conjecture that I’m currently witnessing when talking to data privacy leaders will have begun to diminish and make way for clear and concise action plans. In 2019, there is no data that should be in clear text. Encryption technology is readily available to protect your databases, your files and your e-mails. Used in conjunction with key management solutions and IAM, this provides a very effective defence and demonstrates verified access to your sensitive data estate.</p>
<p>Another big area of change that 2019 will witness is that of the contractual relationships between relying parties. Articles 28 and 30 of the regulation parallel liability for data loss between both the controller and the processor. I am already seeing contract terms much more carefully crafted, incorporating these additional duties, obligations and responsibilities around information security and data governance.</p>
<h1>Jose Sue Smith, Senior Sales Engineer</h1>
<p><em><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/6515/4038/1690/jose_cirlce.fw.png" alt="Jose" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe515391"> Going paperless will speed up the adoption of digital signatures</em></p>
<p>Going paperless will be a must to facilitate digitalization. As a result, this will speed up the adoption of Trusted Digital Signatures in 2019 with the appropriate standards that grant trust to them. It does come with a cost, so the industry will work towards finding ways to maintain the levels of security and reduce the resources needed in processes and hardware, so cloud solutions will continue to prosper.</p>
<h1>Dawn Illing, EMEA, Regional Product Manager</h1>
<p><em><img src="https://www.globalsign.com/files/1815/0782/5014/Dawn.fw.png" alt="dawn" width="85" height="85" class="gs_5c1c0fe5153d8"> </em><em>Rise in ‘novice’ mobile banking users will be a new prime target for criminals - although the attacks will be on the infrastructure, not necessarily the customer</em></p>
<p>Speed and competition mean a radical change in banking models. In 2018, digital banking dominated as Open Banking unfolded and traditional banking models faded away. Phones also increasingly became wallets. In 2019, cyber-attacks will be on the increase - a rise in ‘novice’ mobile banking users will be a new prime target for criminals - although the attacks will be on the infrastructure, not necessarily the customer.</p>
<p>Connectivity is now compulsory which in turn means that industries in 2019 will be quick to recognize and adapt to providing a secure method for verifying digital identities. We also need to remember that in a highly competitive driven market, if a service fails, the repercussions on reputational damage is immense.</p>
<p>In 2017-2018, eIDAS (eElectronic Identification, Authentication and trust services) was not a widely recognized term in the financial sector, however from 2019 onwards, it will be, as financial institutions comply to meet required legal obligations and to ensure they know with certainty who their customers are. This also includes the insurance sector, as regulations on cross-border services and payments in other EU States begins to take effect in the coming year and therefore, customer due diligence becomes paramount.</p>
<p>Consequently, in 2019, security spending is will increase by around 10%, as a result from GDPR privacy concerns as well as requirements around application security and identity access management.</p>
<p><em>Whether you agree or disagree with our predictions, we’d love your feedback either here on the blog, or on <a title="GlobalSign Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/globalsign" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. In the meantime, here’s to hoping that painful lessons learned in 2018 will result in stronger security practices next year, and consequently, fewer breaches and attacks worldwide.</em></p>

<br>
<p><strong>3. Purpose of Processing</strong></p>
<p>Your personal data will be used for the purposes specified below:</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>3.1 To process applications for GlobalSign products and services</strong></p>
<p>Your information is used to provide our products and services and order processing as well as to conduct business transactions such as billing.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>3.2 To improve customer service</strong></p>
<p>Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your pre/post sales requests and provide technical support.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>3.3 To send renewal notices</strong></p>
<p>The email address you provide for order processing may be used to send you renewal notices for your expiring digital certificate.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>3.4 To send service updates</strong></p>
<p>In addition, subject to your consent where required, we may send you new service updates, security updates, related product or service information, and status updates on maintenance windows or service availability.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>3.5 To tell you about our products and services</strong></p>
<p>Subject to your consent where required, we may send you periodic company newsletters, information about our products and services that may be of interest to you based on your use of other GlobalSign products and services, your attendance at GlobalSign sponsored marketing events such as webinars, your requests for information about similar products and services, or your sharing of data with social media sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>4. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We will process your data for the purpose of performance of our contract with you or the legitimate interest of GlobalSign, which are our usual business activities. In other cases, we will request your consent for the processing of the personal data you may submit.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Your refusal to provide personal data to us for certain products and services may hinder us from fulfilling your order for those products or services. Also, if you deny or withdraw your consent to use personal data or opt out of receiving information about GlobalSign products and services this may result in you not being made aware of renewal notices, periodic company newsletters, new service updates, security updates, related product or service information, and status updates on maintenance windows or service availability. See Section 10 below for how to withdraw your consent.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>5. Use of Cookies and web beacons</strong></p>
<p>The GlobalSign Certificate Center (GCC) uses cookies to enable the fulfillment of services. Cookies may be used when you log into the GCC, purchase products or use certain GCC functions.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>In addition, like most online businesses, GlobalSign uses cookies and web beacons on our websites and through marketing related emails to gather and analyze some personal data such as the visitor's IP address, browser type, ISP, referring page, operating system, date/time and basic geographical information.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>We use cookies and web beacons to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications and offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>First time visitors may choose to not have any activity monitoring cookies set in their browser. We use an opt-out identification cookie to tag these users as having made this decision. Those cookies that pertain to site performance, experience improvement and marketing are programmed not to execute when an opt-out cookie is present in a visitor's browser. Opt-out cookies persist until a visitor clears their browser cookies, or until their expiration one year after the set date. A visitor is required to opt out again after one year in order to disable any activity monitoring cookies.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>More details of GlobalSign's use of cookies can be found on our website at <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/repository/cookie-policy/">https://www.globalsign.com/en/repository/cookie-policy/</a></p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>6. Use of application logs for diagnostics or to gather statistical information</strong></p>
<p>Our servers automatically record information ("Application Log Data") created by your use of our services. Application Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We use this information to diagnose and improve our services. Except as stated in section 8 (Data Retention), we will either delete the Application Log Data or remove any account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 12 months.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>7. Sharing of Information and Transfers of Data</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell or trade your personal information to outside parties.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Within GlobalSign: GlobalSign is a global organization with business processes and technical systems in various countries. As such, we may share information about you within our group company and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified in section 3 above and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In cases where your personal data is transferred to countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection according to the European Commission ('adequacy decision'), we ensure your data is protected by entering into agreements containing standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission with each of our group companies. A copy of these agreements may be obtained by contacting us as outlined in section 15 below.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Third Parties: We may also transfer your personal data to trusted third parties and our partners in order to serve purposes that are specified in section 3 above. GlobalSign uses a third party to process credit card payments and provides credit card numbers and identifying financial data directly to the third party credit card processor.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>In circumstances where data is shared with such third parties, they are required to comply with confidentiality terms included in our data processing agreements. This prohibits such third parties from selling, trading, using, marketing or otherwise distributing GlobalSign customer data.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>As Required by Law: We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or protect our rights, property, or safety.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>It is our policy to notify customers of requests for their data from law enforcement unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute or court order. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other process that specifically precludes member notification, such as an order issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2705(b).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions: We may also disclose your personal information to third parties who may take over the operation of our site or who may purchase any or all of our assets, including your personal information. We will contact you using the details you provide if there is any change in the person controlling your information.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>8. International Transfers<br></strong></p>
<p>The third parties, subsidiaries and affiliates to which your personal information can be disclosed may be located throughout the world. Therefore, information may be sent to countries having different privacy protection standards than your country of residence. In such cases, we take measures to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection, which includes the EU Standard Contractual Clauses to protect your personal information.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>9. Data retention</strong></p>
<p>The personal information we collect is retained for no longer than necessary to fulfil the stated purposes in section 2 above or for a period specifically required by law or regulation that GlobalSign is obligated to follow.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>To meet public CA audit requirements as detailed in the GlobalSign Certification Practice Statement, personal data used to fulfill verification of certain types of digital certificate applications will be retained for a minimum of 10 years depending on the class of product or service and may be retained in either a physical or electronic format. Please refer to the GlobalSign Certification Practice Statement for full details.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>After the retention period is over, GlobalSign securely disposes or anonymizes your personal information in order to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>10. Opting out; withdrawing consent<br></strong></p>
<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Renewal notices may be cancelled on a per digital certificate basis by logging into your GlobalSign Certificate Center (GCC) account and disabling renewal notices.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Email preferences for CIT related/collected information can be updated and changed within CIT.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>If GlobalSign is processing your personal data based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time via the GlobalSign Preference Centre at <a href="https://downloads.globalsign.com/acton/media/2674/preference-center-login" target="_blank">https://downloads.globalsign.com/acton/media/2674/preference-center-login</a> or by contacting us at one of the addresses shown in section 15 below.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>11. Your Rights</strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for providing GlobalSign with true, accurate, current and complete personal information. Also, you are responsible to maintain and promptly update the information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.</p>

We will require you to provide identification in order to verify the authenticity as the data subject. We will make reasonable efforts to respond to and process your request as required by law.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>To the extent of applicable law, you may have the right to request erasure of your personal information, restriction of processing as it applies to you, object to processing and the right to data portability. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future services.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>12. How we protect your information</strong></p>
<br>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>After a transaction, your transaction-related information will be kept on file to meet audit requirements and facilitate renewals. We do not retain any credit card details.</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><strong>13. Relevant laws</strong></p>
